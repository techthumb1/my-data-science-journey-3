   - Linear and Logistic Regression
2. `02_support_vector_machines/`
   - Linear and Kernel SVM
3. `03_decision_trees_ensembles/`
   - Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
4. `04_neural_networks/`
   - FNN, CNN (MNIST), RNN, LSTM, GRU
5. `05_clustering/`
   - K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN
6. `06_dimensionality_reduction/`
   - PCA, t-SNE, LDA
7. `07_bayesian_models/`
